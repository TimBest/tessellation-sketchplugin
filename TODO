# in actions
- insert path from tessellate
- delete old selection

# in tessellate
- mutate opposite paths to ones changed

Run these commands:
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist actionWildcardsAllowed -bool NO
defaults write ~/Library/Preferences/com.bohemiancoding.sketch3.plist AlwaysReloadScript -bool NO

try and figure out how to a layer with path in my action listener
